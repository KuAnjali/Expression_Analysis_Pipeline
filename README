Checkout the folder from svn: svn checkout http://

DO: make -f Makefile (already present in the folder) ---> This will create a folder "target" where all the scripts required for the pipeline will be copied automatically.

USAGE: python RNAseq_main.v1.py input.txt config.txt

SERVER: pauling

Example: 

ProjectID	Medgenome_SampleID	ClientID	R1_FASTQ_PATH	R2_FASTQ_PATH	outDir	Grouping
P27654_O51865	55532	Control-K6-2	ANALYSIS/P27654_O51865/Raw_files/Control-K6-2_R1.fastq.gz	ANALYSIS/P27654_O51865/Raw_files/Control-K6-2_R2.fastq.gz	ANALYSIS/anjali.k/Final_RNAseq_pipeline	Control

Important Notes:

	- To start the pipeline, it takes input.txt file from the user. The columns should be tab seperated in the input.txt file.

	- While creating input file, first put all the control samples and than case samples. Please follow this hierarcy, it is important for 		 Differential expression analysis.
	
	- This pipeline is only for 2 group (Case and Control) comparison not for multiple group combination.

	- For Differential expression, grouping information is required. In the last column of input.txt file, define whether the sample belong		 s to Control group or Case group.	

	- In the outDir path: a folder will get created with ProjectID name and inside individual folder with ClientID will gets created.

Config file: Tab seperated file. Turn on the flags according to the project requirements. For running any step after FEATURE_COUNT, the FEATURE_COUNT flag should remain 1. As DESEQ2, DESEQ2_GENE_FILTER and PATHWAY can only be run after featurecount step which makes input file for Deseq2. 
We can add as many number of mail ID's comma separated to send out the combined pdf of QC report in their mail ID.
